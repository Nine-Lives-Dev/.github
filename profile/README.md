# Nine Lives Development LLC

A high-performance engineering studio building modern Web, Mobile, Web3, and AI systems with precision, speed, and taste.

We partner with teams who need more than code — teams who want products that feel fast, look exceptional, and scale cleanly.

Our work spans everything from interactive marketing sites to complex backend infra, automation, crypto integrations, and full-stack product builds.

**Partnered with the Wen Coin Foundation** on web, engineering, and automation initiatives.

Native iOS (SwiftUI 6+) and Android (Kotlin).

Smooth, stable, and designed like premium consumer apps.

### AI & Automation

Custom agents, embeddings, document systems, vector search, n8n workflows, call routing, lead scoring, Slack/Telegram bots, and operational automation.

### Web3 & Crypto

Solana and EVM integrations, wallet flows, staking systems, token dashboards, trading logic, backend services, and secure Web3 onboarding.

### Design & Frontend Experience

High-end interactive frontends using Tailwind v4, GSAP, Lottie, and animation systems.

Brand-level polish with engineering discipline.

## Approach

### 1. Engineering First

We build for scale, clarity, and long-term maintainability.

Clean architecture, strict typing when needed, documented pipelines, and predictable deployments.

### 2. Product Taste

We deliver experiences that feel premium — smooth animations, intuitive flows, and visually coherent interfaces.

### 3. Speed Without Chaos

Small, senior, and fast.

No bloated PM structures.

You work directly with the engineer shipping your product.

### 4. Practical Communication

Clear scopes, transparent roadmaps, async-friendly updates, and deliverables you can track.
